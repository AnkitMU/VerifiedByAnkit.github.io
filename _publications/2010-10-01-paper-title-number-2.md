The Object Constraints Language (OCL), a specification language allows users to specify text-based formal rules over UML graphical models. However, the lack of OCL bench-marks makes difficult to evaluate existing and newly created OCL tools. In this short paper, we propose an approach to automatic OCL benchmark generation. We discuss its feasibility by illustrating different phases and outlining our current progress in this research.
