🔍 **About Me**
=====
I'm a highly motivated researcher with a strong background in **software engineering**, **machine learning**, and **formal methods**. With an Erasmus Mundus joint MSc in Advanced Systems Dependability from **Maynooth University** and **University of St Andrews**, and a B.Tech in Computer Science from **NIT Bhopal**, I bring international academic experience and a drive for innovation.

My core strengths lie in:
- Software Verification & Formal Modelling
Skilled in designing and validating models using tools like OCL, Z3, CVC5, and the USE tool for dependable software systems.

- Automatic Benchmark Generation
Specialized in generating scalable and complexity-aware OCL benchmarks to support fair tool evaluation in model-driven engineering.

- Machine Learning & Data Analytics
Proficient in applying ML algorithms for prediction, classification, and optimization, using libraries such as scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy.

- Full-Stack Web Development
Experienced in building end-to-end applications using Node.js, Express.js, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, and MySQL. Designed secure, responsive, and user-friendly systems with real-world integration like blockchain and face authentication.

- Programming Expertise
Strong programming foundation in Java, Python, C++, and OCL, with effective use of API design, automated testing (Selenium, JUnit), and data processing tools.

- Teaching & Academic Communication
Passionate educator with extensive experience tutoring university-level modules, known for simplifying advanced computer science concepts and encouraging student engagement.

🧪 **Current Research**
=====
**Automatic Benchmark Generation for OCL**  
OCL is a formal specification language used in UML. However, the absence of standardized benchmarks makes it difficult to assess and compare verification tools. My work aims to automate benchmark generation with built-in complexity profiles and solver-based validation, thereby advancing the field of formal verification.

🧠 **Always Learning**
=====
I actively participate in tech seminars and workshops to stay updated on the cutting edge technologies. Curious, resourceful and always open to collaboration — let's build something impactful together!

I’m deeply engaged in the academic community through volunteering, publishing and presenting at international conferences. I enjoy mentoring students as a university tutor and find great satisfaction in simplifying complex topics.

Whether it’s exploring new programming languages, experimenting with machine learning models or optimizing constraint solvers, I believe continuous learning is the foundation of innovation. From theoretical foundations to hands-on implementation, I thrive in environments that challenge me to grow intellectually and creatively.
